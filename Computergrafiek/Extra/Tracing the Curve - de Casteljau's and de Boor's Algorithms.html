Tracing a curve is a simple task.  Dragging the small triangle (<i>i.e.</i>,
the <i>u</i>-indicator) in the right-hand side of the vertical slider moves 
its corresponding point on the curve.  This point is referred to as the 
<b><i>tracing point</i></b>.

</p><h3> De Casteljau's Algorithm </h3>

One can activate de Casteljau's algorithm for tracing a curve. 
<a href="Finding a Point on a Bézier Curve%20 De Casteljau's Algorithm.html"><b>De Casteljau's algorithm</b>
</a> is an elegant algorithm for computing the corresponding point  on a
Bézier curve of a given <i>u</i>.   As shown in the following figure, 
activating button <font face="Helvetica"><b>de Casteljau's Alg.</b></font> 
in the <b><i>Display &amp; Tracing Options Window</i></b> displays all 
intermediate computation steps of the de Casteljau net:

</center>
<p>
The above only displays the de Casteljau net graphically.  This system can
also show the detailed computations step-by-step.  To see this, select
<font face="Helvetica"><b>Window</b></font> followed by
<font face="Helvetica"><b>Triangular Computing Scheme</b></font>.
This will bring up the <b><i>Triangular Computing Scheme Window</i></b>.
This window has a button <font face="Helvetica"><b>STEP</b></font> for
displaying the computation of de Casteljau's algorithm step-by-step.
Clicking on <font face="Helvetica"><b>STEP</b></font> displays the left-most
column which contains all given control points as show below:

</center>
<p>
Clicking on <font face="Helvetica"><b>STEP</b></font> again displays the
second column, each element of which is computed as the combination of the
north-west and south-west control points on the first column.  The south-east
pointing and north-east pointing arrows have values 1-<i>u</i> and <i>u</i>,
respectively.   Note that the points on each column correspond to a polyline
of the de Casteljau net.  Since we have two columns, we have two polylines
of the de Casteljau net.

</center>
<p>
Clicking on <font face="Helvetica"><b>STEP</b></font> twice produces the
following result.  As you can see, we have four columns and hence four
polylines of the de Casteljau net.

</center>
<p>
Clicking on <font face="Helvetica"><b>STEP</b></font> twice again will 
produce a single point, which is the point on the curve corresponding to
the given <i>u</i>.

</center>
<p>
Button <font face="Helvetica"><b>RESET</b></font> resets the computation so
that we can restart the computation.
</p><p>
The vertical and horizontal sliders in the <b><i>Triangular Computing
Scheme Window</i></b> are used for scrolling the 
triangular-shaped computation vertically and horizontally, respectively.

</p><h3> De Boor's Algorithm </h3>

<a href="De Boor's Algorithm.html"><b>De Boor's algorithm</b></a> is
an extension of de Casteljau's algorithm.  De Boor's algorithm can be used
on all four types of curves and when it is applied to a Bézier
curve, it reduces to de Casteljau's algorithm.
Note that in the computation of de Boor's algorithm, unlike de Casteljau's,
not all control points are involved.  As a matter of fact, if the degree of
a B-spline (or NURBS) curve is <b><i>p</i></b>, there are no more than
<b><i>p</i></b>+1 control points involved.  The following shows a B-spline
curve of degree 5 and its convex hull and de Boor net at <i>u</i>=0.14.
Since its degree is 5, only six control points are involved.
Since <i>u</i>=0.14, the involved control points are from 0 to 5.
<p>
Another major difference between de Casteljau's and de Boor's algorithm
is that the weights for computing intermediate control points of the de Boor 
net are not 1-<i>u</i> and <i>u</i>.  In the case of de Boor's algorithm, 
these weights must be computed separately as they are different in each 
stage.  As a result, the new points do not subdivide the line segments 
in a ratio of <i>u</i>/(1-<i>u</i>).

</center>
<p>
Selecting <font face="Helvetica"><b>Window</b></font> followed by
<font face="Helvetica"><b>Triangular Computing Scheme</b></font>
brings up the <b><i>Triangular Computing Scheme Window</i></b>.
This window works for both de Casteljau's and de Boor's algorithms.
However, when the curve is a B-spline or NURBS, only those involving
control points will be shown.  Clicking on 
<font face="Helvetica"><b>STEP</b></font> will display the first column
which is actually part of the control polygon.

Clicking on <font face="Helvetica"><b>STEP</b></font> once computes the
second column:

</center>
<p>
Clicking on <font face="Helvetica"><b>STEP</b></font> two more times
finishes columns 3 and 4.
</p><p>
</p><center>
<img src="Tracing%20the%20Curve%20-%20de%20Casteljau's%20and%20de%20Boor's%20Algorithms_files/de-boor-4-1.jpg" border="2">

</center>
<p>
Clicking on <font face="Helvetica"><b>STEP</b></font> twice again reduces
the number of points to one and this is the point corresponding to 
<i>u</i>=0.14 on the B-spline curve.

<h3> On-the-Fly Computation </h3>

One of the many nice features the curve system provides to you is that you 
can drag the <i>u</i>-indicator to trace the curve and at the same time see
the change of convex hull, de Casteljau or de Boor net, and the triangular
computation scheme for obtaining the corresponding point on the curve.
For example, if the <i>u</i>-indicator moves to <i>u</i> = 0.60, 
you will see a continuous update of the tracing point, convex hull,
de Casteljau or de Boor net, and the triangular computing scheme.
The following figures show the situation at <i>u</i>=0.6.
