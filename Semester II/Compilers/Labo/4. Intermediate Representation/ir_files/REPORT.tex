	\section{Introduction}
	This report describes the performance of three different \texttt{IR} representations of a single \texttt{C} program, \texttt{bubble\_sort.c}. The first \texttt{IR} representation is the standard representation without the function pass. The second \texttt{IR} representation creates a branch at each \texttt{getelementptr} instruction. The third representation is an optimalisation of the second, NOG UITLEGGEN WAT GEOPTIMALISEERD IS.
	\section{Analysis}
	To perform the analysis, the program \texttt{bubble\_sort.c} is executed 30 times for each representation. Afterwards, average statistics can be calculated for each representation.
