	We propose a new method to quickly and accurately predict 3D positions of body joints from a single depth image, using no temporal information. We take an object recognition approach, designing an intermediate body parts representation that maps the difficult pose estimation problem into a simpler per-pixel classification problem. Our large and highly varied training dataset allows the classifier to estimate body parts invariant to pose, body shape, clothing, etc. Finally we generate confidence-scored 3D proposals of several body joints by reprojecting the classification result and finding local modes.
	
	The system runs at 200 frames per second on consumer hardware. Our evaluation shows high accuracy on both synthetic and real test sets, and investigates the effect of several training parameters. We achieve state of the art accuracy in our comparison with related work and demonstrate improved generalization over exact whole-skeleton nearest neighbor matching.

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for human activity recognition (HAR) using the joint angles from a 3D model of a human body. Unlike conventional approaches in which the joint angles are computed from inverse kinematic analysis of the optical marker positions captured with multiple cameras, our approach utilizes the body joint angles estimated directly from time-series activity images acquired with a single stereo camera by co-registering a 3D body model to the stereo information. The estimated joint-angle features are then mapped into codewords to generate discrete symbols for a hidden Markov model (HMM) of each activity. With these symbols, each activity is trained through the HMM, and later, all the trained HMMs are used for activity recognition. The performance of our joint-angleâ€“based HAR has been compared to that of a conventional binary and depth silhouette-based HAR, producing significantly better results in the recognition rate, especially for the activities that are not discernible with the conventional approaches.},,

	abstract = {This paper presents a method to recognize human actions from sequences of depth maps. Specifically, we employ an action graph to model explicitly the dynamics of the actions and a bag of 3D points to characterize a set of salient postures that correspond to the nodes in the action graph. In addition, we propose a simple, but effective projection based sampling scheme to sample the bag of 3D points from the depth maps. Experimental results have shown that over 90% recognition accuracy were achieved by sampling only about 1% 3D points from the depth maps. Compared to the 2D silhouette based recognition, the recognition errors were halved. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of the bag of points posture model to deal with occlusions through simulation.},
